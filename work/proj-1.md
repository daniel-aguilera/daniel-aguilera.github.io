Matt and Dominique had a beautiful wedding at St. Louis! With an elegant reception in the Diamond Hall. The day was full of laughter and love, and decorated beautifully with red touches everywhere you looked. The only thing that out shined the diamond accents that were everywhere, was the joy radiating from the faces of the bride and groom!
